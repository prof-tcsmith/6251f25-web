## Standard Rubric Structure (20 Points)

### Component Distribution
Each assignment typically has 4 main components worth 5 points each:

| Component | Points | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Conceptual Understanding | 5 | Theory and concepts from lectures |
| Implementation | 5 | Coding and technical execution |
| Analysis/Results | 5 | Interpretation and insights |
| Presentation/Documentation | 5 | Code quality, comments, visualization |

### Grading Scale
- **Excellent (100%):** Exceeds expectations, demonstrates mastery
- **Good (80%):** Meets requirements with minor issues
- **Satisfactory (60%):** Basic requirements met with some errors
- **Needs Improvement (40%):** Major issues or incomplete

### Common Requirements
1. **Submission Format:** 
   - Jupyter Notebook: `week[XX]_[StudentID].ipynb`
   - Or ZIP file with all components
2. **Late Policy:** -20% per day
3. **Code Requirements:**
   - Must run without errors
   - Include comments
   - Follow Python conventions
4. **Documentation:**
   - Markdown cells explaining approach
   - Summary of insights

## Implementation Notes

### Week 3-6 Updates Needed:
1. **Reduce complexity:** Current assignments are 80-90 points, need to streamline to 20 points
2. **Focus on core concepts:** Each assignment should target 3-4 key learning objectives
3. **Practical applications:** Use business scenarios relevant to each algorithm
4. **Consistent structure:** 4 parts × 5 points each

### Recommended Structure for Updates:
```
Part 1: Conceptual Questions (5 points)
- Understanding of algorithm
- When to use it
- Advantages/disadvantages

Part 2: Data Preparation (5 points)
- Load and explore data
- Preprocessing steps specific to algorithm
- Train/test split

Part 3: Model Implementation (5 points)
- Implement algorithm using scikit-learn
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Make predictions

Part 4: Evaluation & Insights (5 points)
- Calculate appropriate metrics
- Visualize results
- Business recommendations
```

## Key Principles
1. **Alignment:** Each assignment directly reinforces week's lecture content
2. **Progression:** Complexity builds week over week
3. **Practical:** Real-world business scenarios
4. **Clear Expectations:** Detailed rubrics with specific criteria
5. **Flexibility:** Allow creativity while maintaining standards
